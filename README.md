COVID-19 Aroud the world

The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore provides up-to-date cases of corona diseases. With a small R script, these can be visualized in the form of an interactive treemap.
This time the live data from Johns Hopkins University will be downloaded and read in the form of a CSV file. A tree map makes it easier than a pie chart to show the infected numbers of all countries. In the treemap, the area corresponds to the share of the total number of corona cases. If the share of a country corresponds to 25 percent, the corresponding country takes up 25 percent of the area in the tree map. Thanks to Plotly, the graphics are interactive.
